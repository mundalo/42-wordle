## ABOUT

Recreation of the 5-letter word game 'Wordle' with additional assistant, solver and autoplay function.


## HOW TO PLAY

You guess any five letter word and during the guesses, tiles will change colour to help players get the word. A grey letter means it isn't in the word. A yellow letter signals it is in the word but in the wrong position. A green letter means it's in the word and in the right place. You have 6 tries to get the word right to win the game.

### ASSISTANT
The assistant button can be pressed at any time and will give suggestions based on which words are still available.

### AUTOPLAY
The autoplay can be pressed at anytime and will solve the remainer of the wordle.

### SOLVER
The solver is more sensitive and requires to enter the commands in the correct order. The solver is meant to be used as an assistant to the original wordle game. It will help to narrow down the possible words you can input into the original worlde.

1. go to original wordle and input a word.
2. go back to the solver and input the word you guessed but do NOT press the enter button.
3. press the tiles to change the color of them. You need to make sure the solvers tiles and letters matches the original worlde. When it is identical you can press 'ENTER'.
4. press the assistant button. You should now see a list of words. Try and input one of those words into the original wordle (go to step 1. and repeat until the original wordle has been solved)
